# COVID – 19 dataset
Objective: The objective was to find, extract, clean and transform data regarding COVID -19 from 3 different types of sources: CSV file, website, and an API using Python. Merged the data from the 3 different sources into a one common table enabling me to perform analytics. This was all done using Python.

Tools: I used Python in Anaconda to fulfill this project. The following packages were used for this project: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, BeautifulSoup, Requests, JSON, urlib, CSV.

# Airline Safety dataset
Objective: Created a dashboard in Tableau of six visualizations from 2 datasets - passenger and crew fatalities due airlines crashes from 1908-2022 & fatalities and incidents dataset by airlines from 1985- 1999 and 2000 – 2014.

# Image classification using Tensorflow
Objective: Train the neural network model to classifying the images as accurately as possible. This was accomplished by using Python.

Tools: I used Python in Anaconda to fulfill this project. The following packages were used for this project: Numpy, OS, image, ResNet50, Tensorflow, Keras.

# R

# Avocados Prices Dataset
Objective: The objective was to predict whether the price of avocados will increase, decrease or stay the same in the future? In order to predict that, an ARIMA Time Series Model was built using R.

Tools: I used R in Anaconda to fulfill this project. The following packages were used for this project: Dplyr, Ggplot2, forecast.
